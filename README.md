# Genetic Algorithm for Optimizing Cyber Security Techniques for Large Infrastructures  

## Abstract

This project explores the application of **Genetic Algorithms (GA)** to optimize cybersecurity rule sets. The algorithm evolves **hexadecimal chromosomes**, each representing a defense strategy, by simulating attacks and evaluating their effectiveness. Through the use of diverse initialization techniques, multiple selection strategies, crossover, and mutation, the algorithm iteratively enhances the fitness of these rule sets—culminating in robust, optimized cybersecurity defenses.

## Problem Statement

Modern cybersecurity systems must continually adapt to counter increasingly sophisticated and evolving attack strategies. Designing and optimizing such defense mechanisms is a complex problem due to the dynamic, unpredictable nature of cyber threats.

This project addresses this challenge by applying Genetic Algorithms to optimize security rule configurations, aiming to converge to a highly effective solution that minimizes attack success rates and maximizes defense robustness.

---

## Proposed Solution

The solution uses a Genetic Algorithm that models cybersecurity rules as **10-digit hexadecimal chromosomes**, structured as follows:

- **First 4 digits** → Detection Rate  
- **Next 4 digits** → System Resilience  
- **Last 2 digits** → Response Time

The algorithm evolves these chromosomes over successive generations using genetic operations to find the most effective configuration against simulated attacks.

## Methodology

### Genetic Algorithm Workflow:

1. **Population Initialization:**  
   Begin with a diverse pool of 50 chromosomes to prevent early convergence.

2. **Fitness Evaluation:**  
   A weighted fitness function evaluates each chromosome based on detection rate, system resilience, and response time.

3. **Selection Strategy:**  
   - **Generations 1–10:** Roulette Wheel Selection  
   - **Generations 11–30:** Rank-Based Selection  
   This hybrid approach balances exploration and convergence.

4. **Crossover:**  
   Single-point crossover blends parent traits, ensuring diversity.

5. **Mutation:**  
   Introduces random changes at a rate of 5% to prevent local optima.

6. **Iteration:**  
   Repeat the cycle for 30 generations, selecting and evolving the fittest solutions.

7. **Result Evaluation:**  
   Measure attack success as the inverse of defense effectiveness.

### GA Parameters:

| Parameter         | Value        |
|------------------|--------------|
| Population Size  | 50           |
| Chromosome Length| 10 (hexadecimal) |
| Generations      | 30           |
| Crossover Rate   | 8%           |
| Mutation Rate    | 5%           |

## Results

- The fitness of individuals improved steadily across generations.
- Convergence toward an optimal chromosome was observed by the final generation.
